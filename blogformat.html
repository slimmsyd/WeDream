        <div class = "wrapper">
            <p class ="topic"> <em style="font-size: 21px;">Hello World!</em> I thought that was clever because you know first blog post on my Website and It's topic is Developer related haha? no?</p> 
            <p class ="content">So, the real grind and decision started about 12 days ago, when I came to the conclusion of what language I want to learn and how I will want to implement it. Of course as you can tell I decieded I that JavaScript which came with HTML and CSS. And for a couple reasons why. </p> 
            <h2 class="contenthead">1. I Wanted To See What I Made. </h2>
            <p class ="content">If you start out begninning the code with no coder friends no coding influencers around you or pretty much know nobody who codes. You propobaly Google search the question "What's the most beginner friendly programmer language to learn", or somewhere around those lines. And just basing things on my assumptions you proboblay came across lots articles and videos suggesting <em>Python</em> as the best. For good reason I believe. I was taking this #100daysofCode course on Python and made that little turtle game thingy. You know the one to help beginners understand logic and objects and what not. But shortly after that I realized what I like a lot about coding/programming/devloping right now is seeing what I am creating and how it the code is responding visually.   </p>
            <h2 class="contenthead">2. Developing A Valuable Skill. </h2>
            <p class ="content"> This might be the sole reason why I started coding. Should placed it at the number 1 reason to be honest. It was two books that convinced me that I should learn something transferable and scaleabled and can bring value to others. Not just me. That was the book <em>Mastery</em> by <em>Robert Greene</em> and <em> So Good They Can't Ignore You</em> by <em> Cal Newport</em> I won't summarize the book here; just know it talks quite a bit about cultivating skills in order to grow and navigate within the world. Take for example, me creating the blog-site from scratch might I learned a little bit about using display grid(which I like one I become more familiar with it ). This was a concious choice. It not much about the Blog that I want I could've made one using squarespace. It's much more about learning how to code mysellf and learning  </p> 

            <h2 class="contenthead">3. I Want To Learn How To Build Apps And Much More. </h2>
            <p class ="content"> I won't share too much of my vision, till I developed the right skill set to excute on them. I know personally that I want to build something worth while that is clever, aesthetic, friendly and that has me in it. </p>

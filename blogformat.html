        <div class = "wrapper">
            <p class ="topic"> <em style="font-size: 21px;">Hello World!</em> I thought that was clever because you know first blog post on my Website that I was able to code. Lol</p> 
            <p class ="content"> I'm 21 now and with that maybe people feel the same pressure or fog of wondering, where do  I sit in this world. To my lucky I have found the answer to this question on my own universe. </p> 
            <h2 class="contenthead">1. Aim For Something.... Anything </h2>
            <p class ="content">It really starts with the question. <em>Who are you? And Who could you become?</em> It's really a profound question. Once you ask that you most likely if you we me hit a kind'ov confusion. A door that is not locked, but jammed and you have to critcally think yourself to the answers. That starts it all. It started it all for me. If you ask me personally who am I? I'll say a dreamer. A creative. Hmm, I am  potential. Who could I be? I could be a innovator of change. I could change the Education System. That's some balsey shit to say. Because who am I do think I can change a WHOLE sub-sector of the world? Yet alone transfer that world into another domain? That requires focus, some direction, and some hope, and little more knowledge on game-dev and programming. I could help harbor that transfer of education into virtual reality. I can explain many reasons on why that excites me. Though this is not what this blog is about.  </h2>
            <p class ="content">    Question is still up in the air. What am I aiming for? Because I'm not chasing passion with this code stuff. Lord beleive me. I don't love code. Thought... as I code more I do find it the feedback loop  seeing what you made really rewarding. I'm learning code because it's a transferable, valuable skill. I learn this and can provide value to others that need it. . Can lead to various Job-opportunites. I'm so early in my learning process. It is Day 27 of 100Days of code. Though I started learning code about a month before. Took it really seriously 27 days ago. I'm not even  6 months in. Yet alone 1 year, yet alone 5 years. See I want this, because I'm betting with my future self. I'm betting with time right now. I'm choosing to dedicate most of my free-time to learning code or creating a blog, or recording tikToks. Because I beleive the person a month from now will beneift. The person 2 years from not will benefit. It's a selfish act in a way. One that, I want to take control of. Take responsibility of and act upon.
            <h2 class="contenthead"> Seeing The Best In You </h2>
            <p class ="content"> For me to see and start understanding my limitless potential. Or just the limitliess adadptabilty of humans and are need and willingness to change. Spark the capability in me. That improvement is but a part of of genetic code slim. I know I can adapt and learn. Then execute and apply. I know this. I seen people do it. I seen myself do it. For me it just simply the "continue" process of it. Though I want to and I can't. For me it's like plan A. Plus, if I take if far this will become bigger than me. This will becoming... deep deep to humanity lol.  </p>
